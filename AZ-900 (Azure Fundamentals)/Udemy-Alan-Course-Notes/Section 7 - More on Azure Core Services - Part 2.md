## Monitoring in Azure

- Monitoring tab inside virtual machine
    - Azure monitoring service → Monitor

        ![images/section7/Untitled.png](images/section7/Untitled.png)

    - Monitor Metrics for different resources can be viewed → metrics can be added for multiple comparison → different charts can be added and can be pinned into dashboard

        ![images/section7/Untitled%201.png](images/section7/Untitled%201.png)

    - Monitor can also be used to view logs → Activity logs
    - Alerts can be used to place different alert rules based on different criteria/action
        - Add scope → which machine/target to be used
        - Alert can be based on metrics

            ![images/section7/Untitled%202.png](images/section7/Untitled%202.png)

        - Alert can also be based on Activity log

            ![images/section7/Untitled%203.png](images/section7/Untitled%203.png)

        - Set alert logic → define conditions → define corresponding action based on the alert
        - Action → require an action group
            - Notifications can be used to get alerts

                ![images/section7/Untitled%204.png](images/section7/Untitled%204.png)

        - Alert rule will have some monthly cost
        - Alerts which are fired → can be seen on the alert dashboard

            ![images/section7/Untitled%205.png](images/section7/Untitled%205.png)

## Log Analytics workspace

- environment can be used to store log data
- collect log data from various data sources
- can also be collected from on-premise systems
- or can be collected from diagnostics or log data from Azure storage
- LAB → connect VM to log analytics workspace
    - Create workspace

        ![images/section7/Untitled%206.png](images/section7/Untitled%206.png)

    - Workspace doesn't need to be in the same region as your machine/resource
    - Go to workspace data sources to connect different sources
        - Connect data source to workspace → only connect to 1 at a time

            ![images/section7/Untitled%207.png](images/section7/Untitled%207.png)

        - Once connected → workspace will install log daemon on the VM for logging data
        - You can download windows/linux agent and install on the machines which are on-premise

            ![images/section7/Untitled%208.png](images/section7/Untitled%208.png)

        - Can choose what data to be collected

            ![images/section7/Untitled%209.png](images/section7/Untitled%209.png)

        - Now after collection → logs can be queried

            ![images/section7/Untitled%2010.png](images/section7/Untitled%2010.png)

## Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

- Kubernetes
    - open-source platform → managing containerized workloads
    - provide a DNS name to your container
    - kubernetes → can load balance and distribute network traffic
    - can restart containers that fail
    - can replace or kill containers
    - helps to store and manage passwords/OAuths
- AKS → fully managed kubernetes service on Azure
    - Makes it easy to deploy and manage containerized applications
    - helps to remove the burden of managing the underlying infrastructure for the kube deployment
- **LAB - Azure Container Instance Service**
    - Create Container Instance Resource

        ![images/section7/Untitled%2011.png](images/section7/Untitled%2011.png)

    - Image can be selected from the registry/Docker hub

        ![images/section7/Untitled%2012.png](images/section7/Untitled%2012.png)

    - Public IP address can be used to use nginx image → Azure resource downloads the image and run the container for us
        - No need to manage infrastructure
        - Platform can be used to host containers easily
- **LAB - Azure Kubernetes Service**
    - Create new resource → Kubernetes Service

        ![images/section7/Untitled%2013.png](images/section7/Untitled%2013.png)

    - This resource will spin up a kubernetes cluster (master node) which can be used for orchestration.
    - Once cluster is in place, containers can be deployed inside the cluster

        ![images/section7/Untitled%2014.png](images/section7/Untitled%2014.png)

    - To deploy a `nginx`container inside `kube` cluster
        - use YAML deployment file
            - app.yaml

                ```yaml
                apiVersion: apps/v1
                    kind: Deployment
                    metadata:
                      name: app-deployment
                    spec:
                      replicas: 1
                      selector:
                        matchLabels:
                          app: my-app
                      template:
                        metadata:
                          labels:
                            app: my-app
                        spec:
                          containers:
                          - name: my-image
                            image: nginx
                            ports:
                            - containerPort: 80
                ```

            - Workloads → can be used for deploying containers using YAML file

                ![images/section7/Untitled%2015.png](images/section7/Untitled%2015.png)

        - use YAML service file → exposing the port using LoadBalancer → accessing via public IP
            - service.yml

                ```yaml
                apiVersion: v1
                    kind: Service
                    metadata:
                      name: my-service
                    spec:
                      type: LoadBalancer
                      ports:
                      - port: 80
                      selector:
                        app: my-app
                ```

            - Services and ingresses → can be used to deploy any `kube` service using YAML

                ![images/section7/Untitled%2016.png](images/section7/Untitled%2016.png)

## Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN)

- Used to solve latency problems for accessing static data
- ACDN provide cost effective solution
- Point of presence → have edge servers → located globally
- Users can call to Azure CDN to get static data
- It will take the request from User → direct the call to the closest point of presence based on the user's region → which is then directed to the respective edge server
- Edge servers → cache the static files with respect to request → faster response time
- Edge servers → connect to the origin → hosting web app/storage account/own custom origin
    - If user makes a request that is not present in the edge server → make the request to the origin and send response back to user → also cache it for faster use later
    - You can specify the time to live in the cache (edge servers)

    ![images/section7/Untitled%2017.png](images/section7/Untitled%2017.png)

- ACDN → improves the content delivery by using caching → reduces latency between requests
- **LAB → Implement Azure CDN**
    - Architecture

        ![images/section7/Untitled%2018.png](images/section7/Untitled%2018.png)

        - User requesting resource will go to CDN endpoint that will fetch the resource from Storage account (origin)
    - First, create a storage account → region Central US + LRS (replication)
        - Go to resource → create a container in the blob service → choose anonymous read access
        - Upload some images → to the container
    - Now, create a CDN profile

        ![images/section7/Untitled%2019.png](images/section7/Untitled%2019.png)

        - CDN endpoint can also be created during the creation of profile
        - Choose origin also → storage account can be selected here as the origin

            ![images/section7/Untitled%2020.png](images/section7/Untitled%2020.png)

    - Now CDN profile resource will be created → take endpoint from there
        - Image can be easily fetched via CDN

            ![images/section7/Untitled%2021.png](images/section7/Untitled%2021.png)

        - Request is now flowing through CDN endpoint → connected with the CDN profile
        - Faster access to the resources now → lower latency
        - CDN endpoint will first check whether img1.jpg is present in the point of presence server
            - If img1.jpg is not found → CDN will go to the origin to fetch the data
            - Then it will cache that image for faster access later on
            - TTL can be set for the cache so that stale data is not provided
