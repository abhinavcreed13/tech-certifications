- Create resource - Azure Marketplace
- All resources - will show all resources used
- Resource vs Resource Group
    - Create a VM using VM service → It is a resource on Azure
    - Whatever you create using Azure services → It becomes a resource
    - Resource groups → Logically group resource together
        - Advantage → Manage all resource at a bigger level, example → Assign rules to all resource in 1 go, or delete all resources in 1 go
        - It is like a directory for all resources → manage all resources in 1 go
- Azure geographies

- Azure Subscriptions
    - Create a resource → Always a part of resource group + Location + Selected subscription
    - Subscription can have user-friendly names
    - There can be multiple subscriptions according to the requirements
    - Why multiple? → Maybe you might have different departments and want to separate billing  + controlling the permissions
